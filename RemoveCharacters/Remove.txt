Problem Statement: Given two strings, write a program to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.

Example 1:
Input: String str1 = “abcdef”
       String str2 = “cefz”
Output: abd
Explanation: The common characters in both strings are c, e, f.
So after removing these characters from string 1 we get string resulting string as abd.


Example 2:
Input: String str1 = “xyzpw”
       String str2 = “lmno”
Output: xyzpw
Explanation: As there is no common character in both the strings, string 1 remains unchanged.
