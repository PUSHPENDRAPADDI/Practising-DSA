Jackson, a math research student, is developing an application on triangles in mensuration. For the two triangles on the application’s display, with base and height given, the 
user must identify the triangle with the largest area. Jackson must now write an algorithm to find the area of the larger triangle.


To find the area of a triangle with base and height given, the following formula is used: Area of a triangle = (base*height)/2.
Write an algorithm to find the area of the largest triangle.

Input
The first line of the input consists of two space-separated positive integers – base1, height1, representing the base and height of the first triangle.
The second line consists of two space-separated positive integers- base2, height2, representing the base and height of the second triangle.

Output
Print a real number representing the area of the largest triangle rounded up to 2 decimal places.

Input: 
5 8
4 11
Output: 
22.00
