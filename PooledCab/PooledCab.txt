A company wishes to provide cab service for their N employees. The employees have distance ranging from 0 to N-1. The company has calculated the total distance from an employee's 
residence to the company, considering the path to be followed by the cab is a straight path. The distance of the company from itself is O. The distance for the employees who live to 
the left side of the company is represented with a negative sign. The distance for the employees who live to the right side of the company is represented with a positive sign. The 
cab will be allotted a range of distance. The company wishes to find the distance for the employees who live within the particular distance range.
